# Optokinetic-set-point-adaptation-model
Here we provide the code of the mathematical model to simulate optokinetic slow-phase velocity under directionally alternating stimulation for the paper "Optokinetic set-point adaptation functions as an internal dynamic calibration mechanism for oculomotor disequilibrium". 
Please read and run the script "estimateParamsMedian" to start the simulation. The code is writen in MATLAT R2020a. Example datasets are provided as Median1010, Median105 and Meidan205.Example initial parameters are included in initParamOptimMedianExample.
Further data used in the paper can be found in the Zenodo repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6519477.

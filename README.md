# Optokinetic-set-point-adaptation-model
Here we provide the code of the mathematical model to simulate optokinetic slow-phase velocity under alternating stimulation for the paper "Optokinetic set-point adaptation functions as an internal dynamic calibration mechanism for oculomotor disequilibrium". The data is provided in the Zenodo repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6519477.
